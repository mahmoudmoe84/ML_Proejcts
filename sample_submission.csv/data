The **goal of the competition** is to predict -- from a given snapshot in the game -- for each team, the probability that they will score within the next 10 seconds of game time.\n\nThe data was taken from professional Rocket League matches. Each event consists of a chronological series of frames recorded at 10 frames per second.  All events begin with a kickoff, and most end in one team scoring a goal, but some are truncated and end with no goal scored due to circumstances which can cause gameplay strategies to shift, for example 1) nearing end of regulation (where the game continues until the ball touches the ground) or 2) becoming non-competitive, eg one team winning by 3\u002B goals with little time remaining.\n\n**Files:**\n\n* **train_[0-9].csv:** Train set split into 10 files. Rows are sorted by \u0060game_num\u0060, \u0060event_id\u0060, and \u0060event_time\u0060, and each event is entirely contained in one file.\n* **test.csv:** Test set. Unlike the train set, the rows are scrambled.\n* **[train|test]_dtypes.csv:** \u0060pandas\u0060 dtypes for the columns in the train / test set, which can be pulled and passed to \u0060pd.read_csv()\u0060 on the full set to read it with correct types since by default, \u0060pd.read_csv()\u0060 will use 64-bit types which will waste memory. See below for example code.\n* **sample_submission.csv:** A sample submission in the correct format.\n\n**Columns:**\n* **\u0060game_num\u0060** *(train only)*: Unique identifier for the game from which the event was taken.\n* **\u0060event_id\u0060** *(train only)*: Unique identifier for the sequence of consecutive frames.\n* **\u0060event_time\u0060** *(train only)*: Time in seconds before the event ended, either by a goal being scored or simply when we decided to truncate the timeseries if a goal was not scored.\n* **\u0060ball_pos_[xyz]\u0060**: Ball\u0027s position as a 3d vector.\n* **\u0060ball_vel_[xyz]\u0060**: Ball\u0027s velocity as a 3d vector.\n* For \u0060i\u0060 in \u0060[0, 6)\u0060:\n  * **\u0060p{i}_pos_[xyz]\u0060**: Player \u0060i\u0060\u0027s position as a 3d vector.\n  * **\u0060p{i}_vel_[xyz]\u0060**: Player \u0060i\u0060\u0027s velocity as a 3d vector.\n  * **\u0060p{i}_boost\u0060**: Player \u0060i\u0060\u0027s boost remaining, in \u0060[0, 100]\u0060. A player can consume boost to substantially increase their speed, and is required to fly up into the \u0060z\u0060 dimension (besides driving up a wall, or the small air gained by a jump).\n  * All \u0060p{i}\u0060 columns will be \u0060NaN\u0060 if and only if the player is demolished (destroyed by an enemy player; will respawn within a few seconds).\n  * Players 0, 1, and 2 make up team \u0060A\u0060 and players 3, 4, and 5 make up team \u0060B\u0060.\n  * The orientation vector of the player\u0027s car (which way the car is facing) does not necessarily match the player\u0027s velocity vector, and this dataset does not capture orientation data.\n* For \u0060i\u0060 in \u0060[0, 6)\u0060:\n  * **\u0060boost{i}_timer\u0060**: Time in seconds until big boost orb \u0060i\u0060 respawns, or \u00600\u0060 if it\u0027s available. Big boost orbs grant a full 100 boost to a player driving over it. The orb \u0060(x, y)\u0060 locations are roughly \u0060[ (-61.4, -81.9), (61.4, -81.9), (-71.7, 0), (71.7, 0), (-61.4, 81.9), (61.4, 81.9) ]\u0060 with \u0060z = 0\u0060.  (Players can also gain boost from small boost pads across the map, but we do not capture those pads in this dataset).\n* **\u0060player_scoring_next\u0060** *(train only)*: Which player scores at the end of the current event, in \u0060[0, 6)\u0060, or \u0060-1\u0060 if the event does not end in a goal.\n* **\u0060team_scoring_next\u0060** *(train only)*: Which team scores at the end of the current event (\u0060A\u0060 or \u0060B\u0060), or \u0060NaN\u0060 if the event does not end in a goal.\n* **\u0060team_[A|B]_scoring_within_10sec\u0060** *(train only)*: **[Target columns]** Value of \u00601\u0060 if \u0060team_scoring_next == [A|B]\u0060 and \u0060time_before_event\u0060 is in \u0060[-10, 0]\u0060, otherwise \u00600\u0060.\n\n* **\u0060id\u0060** *(test and submission only)*: Unique identifier for each test row.

It just so happens that one of Kaggle\u0027s software engineers is an avid Rocket League player and he\u0027s assembled a dataset of Rocket League gameplay for this month\u0027s TPS.\n\nThis month\u0027s challenge is to predict the probability of each team scoring within the next 10 seconds of the game given a snapshot from a Rocket League match. Sounds awesome, right?\n\n\u003Cimg title=\u201DID 52\u201D src=\u0022https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Tabular%20Playground/1.jpeg\u0022 style=\u0022float:center; width:600px\u0022\u003E\n\nWell, it\u0027s not *that* simple. The training data is fairly large; trying to read and model it in a single go might pose some challenges. The purpose of this month\u0027s competition is for you to explore ways you can take a big dataset and make it manageable within the time and resources you have. For most people, typical brute force approaches aren\u0027t going to work well. \n\n - Can you scale down the dataset? \n - Can you use, e.g., online learning methods that allow you to train from the data one row at a time? (FTLR is a great place to start if you\u0027re not familiar with online learning! e.g., [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cttsai/instagrat-ftlr-starter)) \n - Can you figure out a nice set of features to reduce the dataset down to? \n\n\n\nIn addition to that challenge, while your predictions must be made pointwise, the training data is made up of timeseries\u0026mdash;maybe you can use that temporal information to improve your model?  This competition also has plenty of opportunity for data visualizations. Let\u0027s see some pretty graphs!\n\n\nSo, share your ideas about tackling this beast of a dataset and have a great time!\n\n\u003Cimg title=\u201DID 52\u201D src=\u0022https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Tabular%20Playground/Featuring%20Rocket%20League.png\u0022 style=\u0022float:right; width:200px\u0022\u003E\n\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis competition includes Rocket League data and images from the [Rocket League Community Tournament Assets](https://epicgames.ent.box.com/s/z14m4isqko9ifumy12e1o4sdy72wyzyz/folder/154490878719).\n\n\n\n","mimeType":"text/markdown","name":"description","isPublished":true},{"id":147731,"postId":13178804,"content":"For every \u0060id\u0060 in the test data, you will be predicting the probability for whether *each*  of the two teams will score a goal within the next 10 seconds of gameplay.
